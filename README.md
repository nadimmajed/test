LODA-Lecture Notes on Data Analysis
===================================

Lecture notes (in form of slides) and excercises in Python using ipython-notebook for teaching data and media analysis.
It includes introductions to Python, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-Learn, SimpleCV.
It covers the topics Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, Signal Analysis, Image Analysis, Text and Web-Media Analysis.

Presentation
============
The lecture notes are optimized for presentation. In order to use them, invoke

  ipython nbconvert --to=slides --post serve path-to-lecture-notes

to start the presentation (a browser window should open automatically).

you can also try to get [livereveal.js](https://github.com/damianavila/live_reveal) up and running in your ipython environment.

Acknowledgment
==============

This work is largely based on a number of great tutorials and resources all over the web, compiled by great people from very different domains. Without their effort and their will to make their hard work open access, i would have not been able to compile this tutorial. The individual contributions are listed in the beginning of every part.
